# Code Review Template Sublime Text Plugin

This is a small plugin which adds a new command to create a code review template in Markdown syntax. The command, when activated via the *Command Palette* will prompt you for a PBI number (ticket number) and a title. Once entered a new tab is created with that information filled into the title and the start of a bullet list is made.

### Activating

In Windows or Linux press **CTRL + SHIFT + P**, and OSX press **CMD + SHIFT + P**, to activate the *Command Palette*, then start typing *code review*. As you type the commands available will start to filter and you should see the command **New Code Review**. Press **ENTER** on this command.

Next you will be prompted to enter a PBI #, which is the same as a ticket number. After entering this press **ENTER**. You will then be prompted for a title. This should be a short description of what the ticket is all about. After pressing **ENTER** you will have a new tab that looks like the image below.
